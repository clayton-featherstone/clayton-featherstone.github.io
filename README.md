Assets (i.e. pdfs, pictures, etc) live in website-assets on the Dropbox.  All links are through Dropbox.  For files like CV.pdf, if you copy a new CV.pdf file to website-assets and let the new version replace the old, then you don't have to recode the Dropbox links in website-code, which is a real time-saver.

Code (html, js, css, etc) lives in website-code. To make the code do live, you must use git to push changes.
